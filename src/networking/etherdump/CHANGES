EtherDump 2.11
IPv4 packet sniffer using raw sockets

Changes by Peter Willis since 2.10:
  * Fix some display inconsistencies
  * Correct several filtering logic bugs (parentheses match separation not supported yet)
  * Remove obsolete settings from help output

Changes by Peter Willis since 2.02:
  * Lots of bugs fixed related to correctly decoding tcp/udp packets
  * Make everything 32-bit and 64-bit compatible
  * Do away with the old 'etherdump-format' output, only tcpdump-like output is supported now
  * Implement ICMP and ARP support
  * Default to 'eth0' interface
  * Change '-h' option to '-H', to reserve '-h' for '--help' (why didn't i do that before?)
  * Rewritten filtering code, should be a little more like pcap-filter(7) now

Changes by Peter Willis since 2.01:
  * Small local getprotoby* implementation to remove dependency on /etc/protocols
  * Clean up some of the tcpdump output
  * Stop outputting 'unsupported IP protocol' by default
  * Add a '-d' debug flag to prevent recompiling to get more verbose output
  * Fixed some potential signedness-related bugs with htons/ntohs
  * Provide reasons in usage for why program failed to run
  * Fix documentation of size, offset of different packet headers
  * Add sequence, ack, win and length to output of tcpdump tcp packets
  * Fix udp length

Changes by Peter Willis since 2.0:
  * Changed configuration option to reflect new name is
    "etherdump", not "packetdump". -p is now -e.
  * Added basic [ipv4] filtering rules.
  * Improved tcpdump output.
  * If etherdump was run as a program named tcpdump, defaults
    to tcpdump-like output.
  * Added -i to specify interface.
  * If EtherDump is executed as "tcpdump", tcpdump-like output
    is the default output type.

Changes by Erik Andersen since 2.0:
  * Converted to getopt instead of a million strcmps
  * cleanup
