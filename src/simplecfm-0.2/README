                   Simple Configuration Management v0.2
                        <peterwwillis@yahoo.com>


                               ABOUT

This tool is designed for lightweight configuration management when you
don't want to implement a more robust tool like puppet or cfengine. We trade
off functionality for simplicity and aim to only provide the bare essential
functionality needed to configure a host or its software.


                               USAGE

To use the tool, first configure a .scfm file according to
documentation.txt.  Check the examples/ directory for more ideas.  Then
simply run the tool with the path to the .scfm file.

All operations are done from the directory of the .scfm file you are
parsing.  It is recommended you use variables with full paths to files you
want to operate on.

To get more verbose information, use '-v'. To test the configuration and not
actually perform any operations, use '--dry-run'.

Read the man page using 'man ./simplecfm.1' or 'pod2man simplecfm | nroff
-man | less'.
