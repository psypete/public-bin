Not everything in here works.

Useful scripts:

 * ipdec.pl                 - Converts from/to dotted or decimal IPv4 addresses
 
 * is_ip_in_range.pl        - Checks if IPv4 address(es) is in a given range(s)

 * ldapcacher.pl            - Proxy an LDAP connection, but keep the remote
                              connection alive indefinitely (helps to keep
                              windows AD servers from blowing up from too many
                              connections)
 
 * portforward.pl           - A basic perl port forwarder

 * print_network_map.pl     - Takes an Nmap XML output and (using traceroutes)
                              prints a basic map of the routes and hosts

 * sshtunnel.sh             - Create an SSH VPN using pppd

 * wrapssh                  - Allows you to use ssh or scp through a jump server
                              without having to log into the jump server first
