Pretty much everything in here works.

This directory is full of scripts I use to better manage my list of hosts to
scan with SAINT. It does everything from classifying hosts based on varying
criteria to excluding IPs in specific ranges and other criteria. There is also
some report-generating functionality to automatically create and e-mail reports
to individuals assigned to specific servers or groups as a whole.
